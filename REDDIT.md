## Post 1: r/statistics

**Title:** I built a free browser-based Kaplan-Meier survival analysis tool — log-rank test, median survival, at-risk tables

**Body:**

Built a free web app for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. It computes survival curves with Greenwood confidence intervals, log-rank test for group comparison, median survival, and at-risk tables — the stuff journals require.

Just paste your time-to-event data with censoring indicators, and it generates everything. Handles right-censored data and multiple groups.

No R, no SAS, no SPSS license needed. Runs entirely in your browser — no data leaves your machine.

Would love feedback from statisticians — what's missing for real clinical data analysis?

## Post 2: r/biostatistics

**Title:** Free browser-based Kaplan-Meier tool — survival curves, log-rank test, at-risk tables without R or SAS

**Body:**

I built SurvivalPlot — a free web tool for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. It does the product-limit estimator, Greenwood standard errors, log-rank chi-square test, and generates at-risk tables that journals want to see.

Designed for clinical researchers who need quick KM analysis without spinning up R or paying for SPSS. Paste your data, get your curves and p-values.

What features would biostatisticians want? Looking for feedback to make this practical.

## Post 3: r/clinicalresearch

**Title:** Free Kaplan-Meier survival analysis tool — no software install, runs in your browser

**Body:**

Built a free browser tool for KM survival analysis. Upload time-to-event data, get survival curves with confidence intervals, log-rank test p-values, median survival, and at-risk tables.

Made this because clinical researchers shouldn't need a statistics software license for standard survival analysis. No install, no login, data stays on your computer.

Would love to hear what clinical researchers need — what would make this useful for your studies?
