# SurvivalPlot — Reddit Launch Posts

## Post 1: r/statistics

**Title:** I built a free browser-based Kaplan-Meier survival analysis tool — log-rank test, median survival, at-risk tables

**Body:**

Built a free web app for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. It computes survival curves with Greenwood confidence intervals, log-rank test for group comparison, median survival, and at-risk tables — the stuff journals require.

Just paste your time-to-event data with censoring indicators, and it generates everything. Handles right-censored data and multiple groups.

Runs entirely in your browser with data staying on your machine.

Would love feedback from statisticians — what's missing for real clinical data analysis?

## Post 2: r/biostatistics

**Title:** Free browser-based Kaplan-Meier tool — survival curves, log-rank test, at-risk tables

**Body:**

I built SurvivalPlot — a free web tool for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. It does the product-limit estimator, Greenwood standard errors, log-rank chi-square test, and generates at-risk tables that journals want to see.

Designed for quick KM analysis directly in the browser. Paste your data, get your curves and p-values.

What features would biostatisticians want? Looking for feedback to make this practical.

## Post 3: r/clinicalresearch

**Title:** Free Kaplan-Meier survival analysis tool — no software install, runs in your browser

**Body:**

Built a free browser tool for KM survival analysis. Upload time-to-event data, get survival curves with confidence intervals, log-rank test p-values, median survival, and at-risk tables.

Built to provide straightforward survival analysis directly in the browser with data staying on your machine.

Would love to hear what clinical researchers need — what would make this useful for your studies?

## Updated Post Footer (add to all posts)

> **A note on this project:** I'm a software engineer exploring what happens when you use AI to build professional tools in domains you're not an expert in. I've built 14 of these so far — across civil engineering, life sciences, optics, and petroleum engineering — and I'm documenting the journey.
>
> The biggest lesson: AI makes coding easy, but **domain expertise is irreplaceable.** These tools work, but they'd be *much* better if built by someone who actually works in this field. If you're a practitioner frustrated by expensive legacy tools, you might be surprised what you can build with AI now.

> I write about this at **[Infinite Practitioner](https://infinitepractitioner.substack.com)** — a newsletter about domain experts building their own software tools with AI.
